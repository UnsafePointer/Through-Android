__Source Code:__  

Through shut down. This was a little experiment to build something cool on top of third party APIs, but it didn't work well at the end, nevertheless I had a great time building the app. Hopefully someone will find something useful here and I always appreciate feedback.  

[iOS](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/Through-iOS) version and [Parse Cloud](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/Through-Cloud-Code) source code are also open source.

__Please note:__

All the API keys are not working anymore, so I didn't bother to remove those from the repository. Also, please read the [license](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/Through-Android/blob/master/License) and don't be a jackass.
